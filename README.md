# Learn You A Haskell
## A repository to follow along with code examples from Miran Lipovaƒça's book [Learn You A Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
### Most code examples are from the book, but I'll be commenting along the way cause I forget stuff

### Why?
Cause I want to! I keep meaning to dig into functional programming and this book seems like a good start

Each chapter of the book will have it's own folder and possible it's own readme to highlight the my takeaways from the chapter
